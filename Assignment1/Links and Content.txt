Q-4
Similarity :- Both are Substitution Ciphers
Difference :- Short vs long key easy to analize and find the key and in second one thougn one can find but difficult than previous one

Why second one is difficult 
Long key 
The general conclusions:
If the key is longer, it is used fewer times in the encryption process, 
therefore, the attacker can obtain less useful statistics from the cyphertext.
The ultimate case of this is the one-time pad, which is a key that is at least as long as the message.
